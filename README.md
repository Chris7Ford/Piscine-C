# Piscine C Coursework

### Introduction

The Piscine C Repository contains all of my original work from the grueling Piscine C at 42 Silicon Valley.  The work posted in here was my first exposure to C and is unedited.  Below, I have also posted my scores for each day, as well as for the exams.

### Challeges

The biggest challenge of th Piscine C was the time management.  I averaged about 90 hours each week for the first three weeks of the piscine.  The hardest part was having multiple assignments at once single time.

On the weekends, we had group projects called *Rushes* as well as personal projects *Sastantua*, *Matchn'Match* and *EvalExpress*.

During the final week, we had a large project Called *BSQ*.

### Scoring

Each of the assignments were peer evaluated by at least 2 classmates.  After the peer evaluations, the assigments were graded my 42's automatic grading system.  The scores that are posted are the final marks.

The minimum passing score for each assignment is 25/100.
